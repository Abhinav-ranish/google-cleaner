### Google Search Sponsored Ad Remover

This project, **Google Cleaner**, removes sponsored ads from Google search results by identifying elements containing the word "Sponsored" and eliminating them from the page. This script works by scanning the page for any elements that display "Sponsored" and removing the entire ad container to give you a cleaner, ad-free search experience.

Check out this video for inspiration behind the project: [Why Google Search Sucks Nowadays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSGVk2KVokQ).

## How it Works
The script looks for the word "Sponsored" in Google search results and immediately deletes the surrounding ad container when the page loads. This results in a more streamlined search experience, free of intrusive advertisements.

## Features
- Scans Google search result pages for "Sponsored" ads.
- Removes the ads and their containers instantly upon page load.
- Provides a cleaner, ad-free search interface.
